# Shared

The `@ucdjs-internal/shared` package provides common utilities and helper functions used across the UCD.js ecosystem.

## Installation

```package-install
@ucdjs-internal/shared
```

## Overview

This package contains shared functionality that is used by multiple UCD.js packages, helping to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication across the monorepo.

<Callout type="info">
  This package is primarily for internal use within the UCD.js ecosystem. If you're building on top of UCD.js, you typically won't need to install this package directly.
</Callout>

## Features

- **Async Utilities**: Helpers for managing concurrency (`createConcurrencyLimiter`) and handling promises (`tryCatch`).
- **Configuration**: Types and functions for loading and parsing `ucd.config.ts`.
- **Fetch Wrappers**: Consistent HTTP fetching with error handling and retry logic.
- **Type Guards**: Shared TypeScript type guards.
- **JSON Utilities**: Safe JSON parsing and stringification.

## Example

```typescript title="shared-example.ts"
import { tryCatch, createConcurrencyLimiter } from "@ucdjs-internal/shared";

// Safely execute async code
const [error, data] = await tryCatch(fetchData());

// Limit concurrency for multiple tasks
const limit = createConcurrencyLimiter(5);
await Promise.all(tasks.map(task => limit(() => processTask(task))));
```
