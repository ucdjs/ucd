# Utils

The `@ucdjs/utils` package provides general utility functions for the UCD.js ecosystem.

## Installation

```package-install
@ucdjs/utils
```

## Overview

This package re-exports shared utilities and provides general-purpose functions used across the monorepo.

## Path Filtering

The package provides utilities for filtering file paths and tree structures, which is particularly useful when working with the Unicode file tree.

```typescript title="filter.ts"
import { createPathFilter, filterTreeStructure, PRECONFIGURED_FILTERS } from "@ucdjs/utils";

// Create a filter for specific files
const filter = createPathFilter({
  include: ["*.txt"],
  exclude: ["Unihan/*"]
});

// Use preconfigured filters
const dataFilesFilter = PRECONFIGURED_FILTERS.dataFiles;
```
