## When to Use

These utility packages are primarily intended for:

- **Internal use** within other UCD.js packages
- **Advanced users** building custom tooling on top of UCD.js
- **Contributors** developing new features for the ecosystem

Most users working with Unicode data should start with the core packages like `@ucdjs/client` or `@ucdjs/cli`.

## Installation

Install utility packages individually:

```package-install
@ucdjs-internal/shared @ucdjs/path-utils @ucdjs/env @ucdjs/utils
```
