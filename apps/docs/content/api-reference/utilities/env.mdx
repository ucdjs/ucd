# Environment

The `@ucdjs/env` package provides environment configuration and variable management for UCD.js applications.

## Installation

```package-install
@ucdjs/env
```

## Overview

This package exports constants and utilities for managing environment variables and configuration across the UCD.js ecosystem.

<Callout type="info">
  This package is used internally by UCD.js packages to handle environment-specific configuration, particularly in the API worker and CLI.
</Callout>

## Constants

The package provides several useful constants:

```typescript title="constants.ts"
import { 
  UCDJS_API_BASE_URL, 
  UCDJS_STORE_BASE_URL, 
  UCDJS_DOCS_URL,
  DEFAULT_USER_AGENT 
} from "@ucdjs/env";

console.log(`API URL: ${UCDJS_API_BASE_URL}`);
```

## Utilities

### `requiredEnv`

Ensures that a specific environment variable is set, throwing an error if it is missing.

```typescript title="env-check.ts"
import { requiredEnv } from "@ucdjs/env";

// Throws if MY_SECRET_KEY is not defined
const secret = requiredEnv("MY_SECRET_KEY");
```
