# FS-Bridge

The `@ucdjs/fs-bridge` package provides an abstraction layer for file system operations, allowing different storage backends to be used interchangeably. This enables your code to work seamlessly across different environments—from Node.js file systems to HTTP-based remote storage.

## Installation

```package-install
@ucdjs/fs-bridge
```

## Overview

The bridge system uses a consistent API across all implementations, ensuring type safety and predictable behavior. Bridges can be read-only (like HTTP) or full-featured (like Node.js), with optional capabilities automatically detected and type-checked.

<Callout type="info">
  The `fs-bridge` is used internally by the `@ucdjs/client` and `@ucdjs/cli` to seamlessly switch between fetching UCD files locally or over the network.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

```typescript title="bridge.ts"
import { createNodeFileSystemBridge } from "@ucdjs/fs-bridge/bridges/node";

const bridge = createNodeFileSystemBridge({
  basePath: "/path/to/directory"
});

// Read a file (returns a Buffer/Uint8Array or string)
const content = await bridge.read("file.txt", "utf8");

// Check if a file exists
const exists = await bridge.exists("file.txt");

// List directory contents
const entries = await bridge.listdir("subdirectory");
```

## Available Bridges

The package includes ready-to-use bridge implementations:
