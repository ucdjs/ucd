# Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `@ucdjs/cli` package provides a command-line interface for working with the Unicode Character Database (UCD). It allows you to explore Unicode data, manage UCD stores, generate code, inspect files, and run data processing pipelines directly from your terminal.

## Installation

You can install the CLI globally or use it via `npx` / `pnpm dlx`.

```package-install
npm install -g @ucdjs/cli
```

<Callout type="info">
  When using `npx` or `pnpm dlx`, simply prefix the commands below with your package runner (e.g., `npx @ucdjs/cli char A`).
</Callout>

## Usage

Run the CLI using the `ucd` command:

```bash
ucd [command] [...flags]
```

To see all available commands and global flags, run:

```bash
ucd --help
```

## Command Categories

The CLI is organized into several subcommands, each focusing on a specific domain of the UCD ecosystem.

## Exploration Commands

These commands allow you to quickly look up Unicode information directly from the CLI.

<Steps>
<Step>
### `char` command
Get detailed information about a specific Unicode character.
```bash
ucd char A
ucd char U+0041
```
</Step>
<Step>
### `block` command
List characters or get information about a specific Unicode block.
```bash
ucd block "Basic Latin"
```
</Step>
<Step>
### `script` command
List characters belonging to a specific Unicode script.
```bash
ucd script Latin
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Store Commands

Manage local UCD stores. A store is a local cache of UCD files that can be used by other `@ucdjs` packages.

- `ucd store init`: Initialize a new UCD store in the current directory.
- `ucd store mirror`: Mirror UCD files from a remote source to the local store.
- `ucd store sync`: Synchronize the local store with the remote source.
- `ucd store analyze`: Analyze the contents of the local store.
- `ucd store status`: Check the status of the local store.
- `ucd store verify`: Verify the integrity of the local store.

---

## Codegen Commands

Generate TypeScript code and types from UCD data.

- `ucd codegen fields`: Generate TypeScript types for UCD fields.

---

## Pipeline Commands

Run and manage UCD data processing pipelines. Pipelines are used to transform raw UCD files into structured data or artifacts.

- `ucd pipelines run`: Run a pipeline from the command line.
- `ucd pipelines list`: List available pipelines in the current project.

---

## File & Lockfile Commands

Interact with UCD files directly.

### `files`

- `ucd files list`: List available files for a specific UCD version.
- `ucd files get`: Download a specific UCD file.
- `ucd files info`: Get metadata about a specific UCD file.

### `lockfile`

Inspect and validate UCD store lockfiles (`ucd.lock`).

- `ucd lockfile info`: Display information about the lockfile.
- `ucd lockfile validate`: Validate the lockfile against the store contents.
- `ucd lockfile hash`: Calculate the hash of the lockfile.

## Global Flags

The following flags are available on all commands:

- `--help`, `-h`: Show help message for the current command.
- `--version`: Show the version number and exit.
- `--json`: Output the result in JSON format (useful for scripting).
- `--force`: Force the operation (e.g., overwrite existing files).
