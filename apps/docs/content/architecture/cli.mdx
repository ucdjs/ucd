# CLI

The `@ucdjs/cli` package provides a command-line interface for working with the Unicode Character Database (UCD). It allows you to manage UCD stores, generate code, inspect files, and run data processing pipelines.

## Installation

You can install the CLI globally or use it via `npx` / `pnpm dlx`.

```package-install
npm install -g @ucdjs/cli
```

## Usage

Run the CLI using the `ucd` command:

```bash
ucd [command] [...flags]
```

To see all available commands and global flags, run:

```bash
ucd --help
```

## Commands

The CLI is organized into several subcommands, each focusing on a specific domain of the UCD ecosystem.

</Cards>

### `store`

Manage local UCD stores. A store is a local cache of UCD files that can be used by other `@ucdjs` packages.

- `ucd store init`: Initialize a new UCD store in the current directory.
- `ucd store mirror`: Mirror UCD files from a remote source to the local store.
- `ucd store sync`: Synchronize the local store with the remote source.
- `ucd store analyze`: Analyze the contents of the local store.
- `ucd store status`: Check the status of the local store.
- `ucd store verify`: Verify the integrity of the local store.

### `codegen`

Generate TypeScript code and types from UCD data.

- `ucd codegen fields`: Generate TypeScript types for UCD fields.

### `files`

Interact with UCD files directly.

- `ucd files list`: List available files for a specific UCD version.
- `ucd files get`: Download a specific UCD file.
- `ucd files info`: Get metadata about a specific UCD file.

### `lockfile`

Inspect and validate UCD store lockfiles (`ucd.lock`).

- `ucd lockfile info`: Display information about the lockfile.
- `ucd lockfile validate`: Validate the lockfile against the store contents.
- `ucd lockfile hash`: Calculate the hash of the lockfile.

### `pipelines`

Run and manage UCD data processing pipelines. Pipelines are used to transform raw UCD files into structured data or artifacts.

- `ucd pipelines run`: Run a pipeline from the command line.
- `ucd pipelines list`: List available pipelines in the current project.

## Global Flags

The following flags are available on all commands:

- `--help`, `-h`: Show help message for the current command.
- `--version`: Show the version number and exit.
- `--json`: Output the result in JSON format (useful for scripting).
- `--force`: Force the operation (e.g., overwrite existing files).
