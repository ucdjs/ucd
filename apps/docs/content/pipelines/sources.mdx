# Sources

Sources define where the raw Unicode Character Database (UCD) files come from. They provide the initial inputs to the pipeline execution.

A source can be local files, HTTP URLs, in-memory data, or any other source that yields file contents.

## Defining a Source

You can create a custom source using `definePipelineSource` from `@ucdjs/pipelines-core`.

```ts
import { definePipelineSource } from "@ucdjs/pipelines-core";

const mySource = definePipelineSource({
  id: "local-files",
  resolve: async (ctx) => {
    // Return a list of files to process
    return [
      { path: "UnicodeData.txt", content: "..." },
      { path: "Blocks.txt", content: "..." }
    ];
  }
});
```

A source must return an array of files, each containing a `path` (the logical identifier or filename) and the `content` of the file.

When a pipeline executes, all of its assigned sources are resolved first, and the resulting files are passed down to the pipeline routes for processing.
