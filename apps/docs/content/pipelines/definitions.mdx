# Pipeline Definitions

A pipeline definition ties together sources, routes, and artifacts. It determines the order in which routes execute based on their dependencies, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

## Defining a Pipeline

Pipelines are created using the `definePipeline` function from `@ucdjs/pipelines-core`.

You provide the sources that yield files, the routes that process those files, and the specific Unicode Character Database versions the pipeline targets.

```ts
import { definePipeline } from "@ucdjs/pipelines-core";

const myPipeline = definePipeline({
  id: "my-pipeline",
  name: "My Processing Pipeline",
  versions: ["16.0.0", "15.1.0"],
  inputs: [mySource],
  routes: [myRoute, anotherRoute],
});
```

The pipeline will automatically construct the execution graph by analyzing the artifact dependencies between the routes. If `anotherRoute` requires an artifact produced by `myRoute`, the execution graph will ensure `myRoute` runs first.

## Loading Pipelines

The `@ucdjs/pipelines-loader` package provides utilities to dynamically load pipeline definitions from files or directories, which is particularly useful for programmatic execution or CLI tools.
