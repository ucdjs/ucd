# Visualizing Pipelines

The `@ucdjs/pipelines-ui` package offers a web-based interface for visualizing pipeline execution, inspecting logs, and debugging route dependencies.

This provides a clear visual representation of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) created by the route dependencies, making it easier to understand complex data processing flows.

## Starting the UI

You can start the pipeline visualization UI via the CLI by appending the `--ui` flag when running a pipeline.

```bash
ucd pipelines run my-pipeline --ui
```

This command will open a local web server displaying the UI. The interface provides several views and tools:

- **DAG Visualization**: A visual graph showing the dependencies and execution order of the defined routes.
- **Execution Timings**: Information about the execution duration for each route and the entire pipeline.
- **Artifact Inspection**: The ability to inspect the structured artifacts emitted by each completed route.
- **Logs**: Detailed execution logs and error messages associated with individual routes.

This visual feedback is invaluable when developing custom pipelines or debugging data processing errors.
