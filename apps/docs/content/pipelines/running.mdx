# Running Pipelines

Pipelines can be executed either programmatically using the `@ucdjs/pipelines-core` library or via the `ucd` CLI tool, which utilizes the pipeline executor under the hood.

  <Tab value="CLI">
    The CLI provides an easy way to interact with defined pipelines in your project.

    ```bash
    # List available pipelines in your project
    ucd pipelines list

    # Run a specific pipeline by ID
    ucd pipelines run my-pipeline
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Programmatic">
    To run pipelines programmatically, you use `createPipelineExecutor` from `@ucdjs/pipelines-core`. This executor manages the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution, resolving dependencies, running routes in parallel where possible, and handling source resolution.

    ```ts
    import { createPipelineExecutor } from "@ucdjs/pipelines-core";

    const executor = createPipelineExecutor({ 
      pipelines: [myPipeline] 
    });
    
    // Run the defined pipeline
    const result = await executor.run();
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The executor analyzes the dependencies between routes defined by their required artifacts and ensures they execute in the correct topological order. If an error occurs in a route, it halts downstream dependencies while allowing independent routes to complete if possible.
