# Installation

<Callout type="warn">
  This documentation is for a pre-release version of UCD.js. The API and features may change before the stable release.
</Callout>

UCD.js is a modular project, meaning you can install only the specific packages you need. The most common packages to install are the **Client** and the **CLI**.

## Package Installation

Install the UCD.js packages you need using your preferred package manager. For example, to install the client and file system bridge:

```package-install
@ucdjs/client @ucdjs/fs-bridge
```

### Basic Usage

Start using UCD.js in your project:

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { createClient } from '@ucdjs/client';

// Initialize the client
const client = createClient();

// Fetch Unicode data (example)
const data = await client.getCharacter('A');
console.log(data);
```

<Callout type="info">
  Check out the [Client API Reference](/api-reference/client) to learn more about interacting with the UCD.js client.
</Callout>

## CLI Installation

The UCD.js CLI provides powerful command-line utilities for Unicode exploration and analysis.

### Install the CLI globally

```package-install
-g @ucdjs/cli
```

### Explore Unicode data

Use the CLI to explore Unicode characters and properties directly from your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
ucd char A
ucd block "Basic Latin"
ucd script Latin
```

### Get help

Access help and documentation for CLI commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
ucd --help
ucd char --help
```
