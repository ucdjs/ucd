# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions we get about UCD.js and the Unicode Character Database.

## General

### What is UCD.js?

UCD.js is a TypeScript/JavaScript monorepo filled with packages that simplify downloading, parsing, validating, and interacting with the complex text files of the Unicode Character Database (UCD).

### Which Node.js version is required?

UCD.js requires Node.js `^24.13.0` or newer. We rely on modern JavaScript APIs and ECMAScript modules (ESM).

### Is UCD.js meant for the frontend or backend?

Both! The `@ucdjs/client` and `@ucdjs/fs-bridge` architectures are designed to be environment agnostic. You can fetch Unicode data from HTTP in the browser or read files locally in Node.js/Bun.

## Data & Unicode

### Does this include all Unicode characters?

Yes. UCD.js schemas and pipelines process the official release files published by the Unicode Consortium. You have access to the entire standard.

### How often are the schemas updated?

When the Unicode Consortium releases a new version (for example, moving from Unicode 15 to 16), UCD.js generates new Zod schemas to accurately reflect the latest specifications and property types.

### Can I process my own custom `.txt` files using UCD.js?

Absolutely. The `@ucdjs/pipelines-*` system is incredibly robust and pluggable. You can define custom `Sources` and `Routes` to parse whatever specific format you need while leveraging the built-in graph execution.
