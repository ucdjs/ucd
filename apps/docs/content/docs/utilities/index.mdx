# Utilities

The UCD.js ecosystem includes several utility packages that provide common functionality across the project.

## Available Packages

- **[Shared](/docs/utilities/shared)** - Shared utilities used across UCD.js packages
- **[Path Utils](/docs/utilities/path-utils)** - Path manipulation utilities for working with file paths
- **[Environment](/docs/utilities/env)** - Environment configuration and variable management
- **[Utils](/docs/utilities/utils)** - General utility functions

## When to Use

These utility packages are primarily intended for:

- **Internal use** within other UCD.js packages
- **Advanced users** building custom tooling on top of UCD.js
- **Contributors** developing new features for the ecosystem

Most users working with Unicode data should start with the core packages like `@ucdjs/ucd-store` or `@ucdjs/cli`.

## Installation

Install utility packages individually:

```bash npm
npm install @ucdjs-internal/shared @ucdjs/path-utils @ucdjs/env @ucdjs/utils
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @ucdjs-internal/shared @ucdjs/path-utils @ucdjs/env @ucdjs/utils
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @ucdjs-internal/shared @ucdjs/path-utils @ucdjs/env @ucdjs/utils
```
