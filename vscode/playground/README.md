# VSCode Extension Development Workspace

This folder provides a consistent development environment when working on the UCD extension.

When you press F5 to debug the extension:
1. The extension builds in watch mode
2. A new VSCode window opens with this folder as the workspace
3. The UCD extension is loaded in the new window

This ensures you always have the same context and configuration during development.
